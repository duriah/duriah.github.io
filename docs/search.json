We found that it switched from a Type III to a Type II at the highest temperature. We used simulations to illustrate the destabilizing effect of this change.\n    Find out more\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n     Forecasting the face of ecological complexity \n     We quantified how ecological complecity affectes forecast skill of species abundances within and across systems. We found that in general we forecasted generalist species (many but weak interactions) better than specialist species (few but strong interactions). \n    Find out more"
