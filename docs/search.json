    "text": "Extended abstract with figures\n\nThe potential for climate change and temperature shifts to affect community stability remains relatively unknown. One mechanism by which temperature may affect stability is by altering trophic interactions. The functional response quantifies the per capita resource consumption by the consumer as a function of resource abundance and is a suitable framework for the description of nonlinear trophic interactions.\nWe studied the effect of temperature on a ciliate predator–prey pair (Spathidium sp. and Dexiostoma campylum) by estimating warming effects on the functional response and on the associated conversion efficiency of the predator.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe recorded prey and predator dynamics over 24 hr and at three temperature levels (15, 20 and 25°C).\n\n\n\n\n\nTo these data, we fitted a population dynamic model including the predator functional response, such that we estimated the functional response parameters (space clearance rate, handling time and density dependence of space clearance rate) for each temperature separately. To evaluate the ecological significance of temperature effects on the functional response parameters, we simulated predator–prey population dynamics. We considered the predator–prey system to be destabilized, if the prey was driven extinct by the predator.\n\n\n\n\n\nEffects of increased temperature included a transition of the functional response from a Type III to a Type II and an increase of the conversion efficiency of the predator. The simulated population dynamics showed a destabilization of the system with warming, with greater risk of prey extinction at higher temperatures likely caused by the transition from a Type III to a Type II functional response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarming‐induced shifts from a Type III to II are not commonly considered in modelling studies that investigate how population dynamics respond to warming. Future studies should investigate the mechanism and generality of the effect we observed and simulate temperature effects in complex food webs including shifts in the type of the functional response as well as consider the possibility of a temperature‐ dependent conversion efficiency.\n\n\nDaugaard, U., Petchey, O.L. & Pennekamp, F.

    "text": "Extended abstract with figures\nFacing climate change and biodiversity loss, it is critical that ecology advances so that processes, such as species interactions and dynamics, can be correctly estimated and skillfully forecasted. As different processes occur on different time scales, the sampling frequency used to record them should intuitively match these scales. Yet, the effect of data sampling frequency on ecological forecasting accuracy is understudied. Using a simple simulated dataset as a baseline and a more complex high-frequency plankton dataset, we tested how different sampling frequencies impacted abundance forecasts of different plankton classes and the estimation of their interactions.\n\n\n\nWe then investigated whether plankton growth rates and body sizes could be used to select the most appropriate sampling frequency. The simple simulated dataset showed that the optimal sampling frequency scaled positively with growth rate. This finding was not repeated in the analyses of the plankton time series, however. There, we found that a reduction in sampling frequency worsened forecasts and led us to both over- and underestimate plankton interactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis suggests that forecasting can be used to determine the ideal sampling frequency in scientific and monitoring programs. A better study design will improve theoretical understanding of ecology and advance policy measures dealing with current global challenges.\n\nDaugaard, U., Merkli, S., Merz, E., Pomati, F. & Petchey, O.L.

    "text": "About me\nI am currently doing a PhD in ecology at the University of Zurich (UZH) in the Predictive Ecology Group led by Prof. Owen L. Petchey (OLP) and which I will conclude towards the end of 2024. I am fascinated by the complexity and diversity of ecological systems and I strive to discover and explain new things about them. I am always keen to extend my horizon with new methods, topics and collaborations about and beyond my current scientific focus.\nI have a Master in Biostatistics (UZH, 2018-2020, thesis supervisors: Prof. Reinhard Furrer and OLP) and a Bachelor in Biology (Major) and Environmental Sciences (Minor, UZH, 2015-2018).\n\n\n\n\n\nMy research\nThe focus of my PhD research is on ecological forecasting and associated questions such as:\n\nWhat makes certain ecological systems and measures more predictable than others?\nAre there general relations between species or ecosystem characteristics and how well these can be predicted?\nHow do such relations scale with environmental change/stressors?\n\nTo tackle these questions I work at the intersection of data and theory. I conduct quantitative analyses (e.g. estimation of species interactions and networks) and forecasts, with a special focus on reproducibility and open science.\n\nModel system\nI often work with laboratory based microbial aquatic ecosystems (i.e. protist microcosms). For instance, in a team led by Dr. Romana Limberger (RL) we recently carried out 2 long-term (9 months, ~120 time points) microcosm experiments in which we manipulated biodiversity and stressors (soon™ to be published).\nI also work with observational data (e.g. lake plankton monitoring optimization, a collaboration with Dr. Francesco Pomati, Stefanie Merkli, Dr. Ewa Merz and OLP, more info here) and with simulations.\n\n\nData analysis\nI generally use various non-parametric (machine learning) approaches to forecasting (such as empirical dynamic modelling, random forest and recurrent neural networks) and arima. For instance, I, Dr. Stephan B. Munch, OLP and coauthors investigated how taxa abundance forecasts depend on ecological complexity within and across systems and found that generalist species are forecasted better than specialists (more info here).\nIn my current research project I am working with a more mechanistic approach to forecasting, in which I combine population dynamics with generalized additive models.\n\n\nOther projects\nDuring my Bachelor studies I did a 3 months internship with Dr. Frank Pennekamp (main supervisor) and OLP. In the project, we found that warming can cause a destabilizing type switch in a predator-prey functional response (more info here). For this publication, I won the 2019 Elton Prize (best research paper in the Journal of Animal Ecology by an early career author).\nI am also coauthor in two microbiology projects led by Dr. Marcel Suleiman in which we studied the effects of multiple stressors on bacterial communities kept in special Winogradsky columns, and in a projects led by RL in which we investigated the role of functional diversity in regime shifts (see the publications tab).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelected Publications\n\nDaugaard, U., Petchey, O.L. & Pennekamp, F.
