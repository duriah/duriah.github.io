We found that it switched from a Type III to a Type II at the highest temperature. We used simulations to show the destabilizing effect of this change.\n    Find out more\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n     Forecasting in the face of ecological complexity \n     We quantified how ecological complexity affectes forecast skill of species abundances within and across systems. We found that in general we forecasted generalist species (many but weak interactions) better than specialist species. \n    Find out more\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n     Using forecasts to improve monitoring in community ecology \n    We show how forecasts deteriorate with decreasing sampling frequency across all taxa in a unique lake plankton data set. We then turn the tables and discuss how forecast skill can help optimize sampling and monitoring in community ecology. \n    Find out more"
