The topics include among other things data visualization and processing, statistical (hypothesis) testing, linear regression (including ANOVA), logistic regression, Poisson regression, linear mixed models, introduction to linear algebra for linear models, goodness-of-fit measures, etc. The theoretical lectures are paired with hands-on practical sessions that are further accompanied by flipped-classroom style videos.\n\n\nMy experience teaching the course: I taught four of the theoretical lectures (in 2024). Teaching such a large class was an enriching and challenging experience for me in which I learnt a lot about lecturing and what it involves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching Assistant (TA)\n\n\nBIO144 (Data analysis in biology, 2021-2023, spring semester, UZH)\n\n\nDescription: as a teaching assistant I helped the students with the practical exercises and answered methodological and computational (R) questions. I was also the main contact person for the students outside the practical hours when it came to statistical questions, and I answered questions on the course forum and I proactively wrote a statistical and computational FAQ for the students.\n\n\nHead TA: further, in 2022 and 2023 I was also Head TA, which involved additional responsibilities such as the screening of potential TAs and the briefing and organisation of the selected TAs (and being their main contact person).\n\nR4All : An Introduction to the the Basics of R (May 12-13, 2022)\n\nDescription: A two-day course given for novice R users with a life and environmental science background."

    "text": "About me\nI am currently doing a PhD in ecology at the University of Zurich (UZH) in the Predictive Ecology Group led by Prof. Owen L. Petchey (OLP) and which I will conclude towards the end of 2024. I am intrinsically motivated by science and I am always keen to extend my horizon with new methods, topics and collaborations beyond my current scientific focus.\nI have a Master in Biostatistics (UZH, 2018-2020, thesis supervisors: Prof. Reinhard Furrer and OLP) and a Bachelor in Biology (Major) and Environmental Sciences (Minor, UZH, 2015-2018).\n\n\n\n\n\nMy research\nThe focus of my PhD research is on ecological forecasting and associated questions such as: 1. What makes certain ecological systems and measures more predictable than others? 2. Are there general relations between species or ecosystem characteristics and how well these can be predicted? 3. How do such relations scale with environmental change/stressors?\nTo tackle these questions I work at the intersection of data and theory. I conduct quantitative analyses (e.g. estimation of species interactions and networks) and forecasts, with a special focus on reproducibility and open science.\nAs a model system, I often work with laboratory based microbial aquatic ecosystems (i.e. protist microcosms). For instance, in a team led by Dr. Romana Limberger we recently carried out 2 long-term (9 months, ~120 time points) microcosm experiments in which we manipulated biodiversity and stressors (soon™ to be published). I also work with observational data (e.g. lake plankton monitoring optimization, a collaboration with Dr. Francesco Pomati, Stefanie Merkli, Dr. Ewa Merz and OLP, more info here) and with in silico data (i.e. simulations).\nI generally use various non-parametric (machine learning) approaches to forecasting (such as empirical dynamic modelling, random forest and recurrent neural networks) and arima. For instance, I, Dr. Stephan B. Munch, OLP and coauthors investigated how taxa abundance forecasts depend on ecological complexity within and across systems and found that generalist species are forecasted better than specialists (more info here). In my current research project I am working with a more mechanistic approach to forecasting, in which I combine population dynamics with generalized additive models.\nOther projects. During my Bachelor studies I did a 3 months internship with Dr. Frank Pennekamp (main supervisor) and OLP. In the project, we found that warming can cause a destabilizing type switch in a predator-prey functional response (more info here). For this publication, I won the 2019 Elton Prize (best research paper in the Journal of Animal Ecology by an early career author). I am also coauthor in two microbiology projects led by Dr. Marcel Suleiman in which we studied the effects of multiple stressors on bacterial communities kept in special Winogradsky columns (see the publications tab).\n\n\n\n\n\nSelected Publications\n\nDaugaard, U., Petchey, O.L. & Pennekamp, F.
