### About me

I am currently doing a [PhD in ecology](https://www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/teaching/phd/graduate.html){target="_blank"} at the [University of Zurich (UZH)](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html){target="_blank"} in the [Predictive Ecology Group](https://thetrophiclink.org/){target="_blank"} led by [Prof. Owen L. Petchey](https://www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/staff/member/petchey_owen.html){target="_blank"} (OLP) and which I will conclude towards the end of 2024. I am intrinsically motivated by science and I am always keen to extend my horizon with new methods, topics and collaborations beyond my current scientific focus.

I have a Master in [Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.uzh.ch/){target="_blank"} (UZH, 2018-2020, thesis supervisors: [Prof. Reinhard Furrer](https://user.math.uzh.ch/furrer/){target="_blank"} and OLP) and a Bachelor in Biology (Major) and Environmental Sciences (Minor, UZH, 2015-2018).

###  My research

**The focus of my PhD research is on ecological forecasting** and associated questions such as: **1.** What makes certain ecological systems and measures more predictable than others? **2.** Are there general relations between species or ecosystem characteristics and how well these can be predicted? **3.** How do such relations scale with environmental change/stressors?

**To tackle these questions I work at the intersection of data and theory.** I conduct quantitative analyses (e.g. estimation of species interactions and networks) and forecasts, with a special focus on reproducibility and open science. 

**As a model system**, I often work with laboratory based **microbial aquatic ecosystems (i.e. protist microcosms)**. For instance, in a team led by [Dr. Romana Limberger](https://www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/staff/member/limberger_romana.html){target="_blank"} we recently carried out 2 long-term (9 months, \~120 time points) microcosm experiments in which we manipulated biodiversity and stressors (soon™ to be published). I also work with observational data (e.g. lake plankton monitoring optimization, a collaboration with [Dr. Francesco Pomati](https://www.eawag.ch/en/about-us/portrait/organisation/staff/profile/francesco-pomati/show/){target="_blank"}, [Stefanie Merkli](https://www.eawag.ch/de/ueber-uns/portraet/organisation/mitarbeitende/profile/stefanie-merkli/show/){target="_blank"}, [Dr. Ewa Merz](https://www.eawag.ch/en/about-us/portrait/organisation/staff/profile/ewa-merz/show/){target="_blank"} and OLP, more info [here](/ResearchPages/SamplingFreq.qmd)) and with simulations.

I generally use various **non-parametric (machine learning) approaches to forecasting** (such as empirical dynamic modelling, random forest and recurrent neural networks) and arima. For instance, I, [Dr. Stephan B. Munch](https://sbmunch.sites.ucsc.edu/){target="_blank"}, OLP and coauthors investigated how taxa abundance forecasts depend on ecological complexity within and across systems and found that generalist species are  forecasted better than specialists (more info [here](/ResearchPages/EcoComplexEcoForecast.qmd)). In my current research project I am working with a more **mechanistic** approach to forecasting, in which I combine population dynamics with generalized additive models.

**Other projects**. During my Bachelor studies I did a 3 months internship with [Dr. Frank Pennekamp](https://www.frank-pennekamp.info/){target="_blank"} (main supervisor) and OLP. In the project, we found that warming can cause a destabilizing type switch in a predator-prey functional response (more info [here](/ResearchPages/warmingFRpage.qmd)). For this publication, I won the [2019 Elton Prize](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/publications/best-paper-by-an-early-career-researcher/elton-prize/){target="_blank"} (best research paper in the Journal of Animal Ecology by an early career author). I am also coauthor in two microbiology projects led by [Dr. Marcel Suleiman](https://www.fhnw.ch/en/people/marcel-suleimann){target="_blank"} in which we studied the effects of multiple stressors on bacterial communities kept in special Winogradsky columns (see the publications tab).
