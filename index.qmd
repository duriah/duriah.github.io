# About me

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Zurich (UZH) in the Predictive Ecology Group under [Prof. Owen Petchey](#).

Finishing end of 2024, 
<!-- looking for exciting new opportunities to do science. -->

the over-arching topic of my PhD is forecasting...
  - link to two highlighte papers
  - methodologies used
  - focus on explaining forecast skill/error
  
species networks, interactions, quantitaivereserach, etc.  
  
to answer my research question I use empirical data, which in many cases is experimental (ciliate microcosms... more info). For instance, LEEF1 and LEEF2 (link to romana)

I've also worked with observational data (lake plankton, e.g., ... collaboration with Pomati and team) and with *in silico* data (i.e. simulations)

look what you wrote on owens page... also write if interst in working on other projects? and learning new thins

focus on reproduciblity and open science

Previous to my PhD studies, my first real science experience came from a 3 months internship I did in 2018 with Owen and Frank Pennekamp LINK (main supervisor) during my Biology (Major) and Environmental Sciences (Minor) Bachelor at UZH (2015-2018). We investigated .. (link to highlight)
This eventually resulted in my first publication in 2019 (link) in the Journal of Animal Ecology, for which I was awarded the Elton prite (link, somewhere description of what it is)



Master biostat, furrer, thesis, focus of program. why I chose it, etc.
